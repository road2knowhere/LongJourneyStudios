# Privacy Policy for LoJurn

**Effective Date:** 2025-09-15

Welcome to Lojurn ("we," "us," "our," or "LoJurn"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the LoJurn mobile application (the "App").

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the handling of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Information We Process and How We Use It

We design LoJurn with your privacy in mind, aiming to minimize the data processed. We do not directly collect or store your personal information on our own servers. However, the App utilizes certain functionalities and third-party services that may process data as described below:

* **Locally Stored Data (Your Journal Entries, Settings & Preferences):**
    * **What:** LoJurn allows you to create and store journal entries, including text and potentially images (if you choose to add them). Your app settings, preferences (such as enabled prompt packs or if ads are removed), and other app-specific data are also stored.
    * **How:** This data is stored locally on your device using technologies like SQLite (`sqflite`) and shared preferences (`shared_preferences`).
    * **Why:** To provide the core functionality of the App, allowing you to create, view, and manage your journal entries and personalize your app experience. We do not have access to this data. You have control over this data on your device.

* **In-App Purchases:**
    * **What:** If you choose to make an in-app purchase, such as "Remove Ads," the transaction is processed by the respective app store (Google Play Store or Apple App Store). We may receive confirmation of your purchase status (e.g., to verify that ads should be removed) but we do not receive or store your payment card details.
    * **How:** Handled by Google Play Billing (`in_app_purchase`) or Apple's App Store.
    * **Why:** To manage and validate in-app purchases. Please refer to the privacy policies of Google and Apple for more information on how they handle your data for purchases.

* **Advertising (Google AdMob):**
    * **What:** The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements if you have not purchased the "Remove Ads" feature. AdMob may collect and use data to provide personalized advertising. This data can include device identifiers (like Advertising ID), IP address, device information, and information about your interaction with ads.
    * **How:** Through the `google_mobile_ads` package.
    * **Why:** To support the App financially by displaying advertisements.
    * **Your Choices:** You can typically control personalized advertising through your mobile device's settings (e.g., "Opt out of Ads Personalization" on Android or "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS). For more information on how Google uses data for advertising, please visit [How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

* **Device Information and Usage Data (Limited):**
    * **What:** The App may access basic device information (using `device_info_plus`) and package information (`package_info_plus`) for functional and diagnostic purposes. This might include device model, operating system version, and app version.
    * **How:** Through standard app functionalities and packages.
    * **Why:** To ensure compatibility, aid in troubleshooting, and improve the App's performance. This data is generally aggregated or anonymized if used for analytics by third-party services like AdMob.

* **Files and Media (User-Initiated):**
    * **What:** If you use features like image picking (`image_picker`) or file picking (`file_picker`) to add images to entries or for import/export functionalities, the App will access the files you explicitly select.
    * **How:** Access is granted by you through system permission dialogs and file selection interfaces.
    * **Why:** To enable you to include images in your journal entries or manage app data through import/export. These files are processed locally as part of your journal data or for the specific function you initiated.

* **Permissions:**
    * **What:** The App may request certain permissions (using `permission_handler`) to access device functionalities like storage (for import/export, saving PDFs), notifications (if implemented), or biometrics (if implemented).
    * **How:** You grant these permissions through system dialogs.
    * **Why:** These permissions are only requested when necessary for specific features to function.

## 2. Third-Party Services

As mentioned, we use third-party services, most notably:

* **Google AdMob:** For serving advertisements. Their use of data is governed by Google's privacy policies. We encourage you to review their policies.
* **Google Play Store / Apple App Store:** For handling in-app purchases and app distribution. Their data practices are outlined in their respective privacy policies.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties.

## 3. Data Security

We take reasonable steps to help protect information processed by the App. Since your primary journal data is stored locally on your device, the security of that data largely depends on the security of your device itself (e.g., using a passcode, keeping your OS updated). For any data transmitted to third-party services like AdMob, they are responsible for their own security measures.

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

* **Locally Stored Data:** Your journal entries and app settings remain on your device until you choose to delete them (either individual entries, by clearing app data through your device settings, or by uninstalling the App).
* **Third-Party Data:** Data collected by third parties like Google AdMob is subject to their retention policies.

## 5. Your Rights and Choices

* **Accessing and Deleting Local Data:** You can access and delete your journal entries directly within the App. You can also clear all app data or uninstall the App to remove all locally stored information.
* **Managing Ad Personalization:** You can typically manage your preferences for personalized advertising through your mobile device's settings.
* **In-App Purchases:** If you have made an in-app purchase and have issues, please contact the respective app store or us for support in verifying purchase status.

## 6. Children's Privacy

LoJurn is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or a higher age if stipulated by local laws). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child, we will take steps to delete it. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or through other appropriate communication channels. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.
